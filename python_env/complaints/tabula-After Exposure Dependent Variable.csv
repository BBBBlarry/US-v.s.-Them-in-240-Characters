"",To whom it may Concern: My comment,,,,,
"",regarding The Supplemental Arroyo,,,,,
"",Grande Aquifer submission data,,,,,
"",submitted by DOGGR for public comment,,,,,
"",is that I find the information inadequate,,,,,
"",and unacceptable. Here are several,,,,,
"",reasons why I feel the information is of no,,,,,
"",consequence to the issue at hand. I will,,,,,
"",not feel safe or confident that no harm,,,,,
"",will come to this community now or in the,,,,,
"",near future until these issues are resolved.,,,,,
"",The data does not address any of these,,,,,
"",issues. 1. The site has not met any of the,,,,,
"",standards or legal criteria for a Class I or II,,,,,
"",waste disposal site. 2. Injection of fluids,,,,,
"",begins only after the EPA approves an,,,,,
"",aquifer exemption and an underground,,,,,
"",injection control permit is granted not the,,,,,
"",other way around. 3. The Hazardous and,,,,,
"",Solid Waste Amendments (HSWA) to the,,,,,
"",RCRA includes Class I hazardous waste,,,,,
"","injection wells, prohibiting disposal unless",,,,,
"",the waste has been treated to become,,,,,
"",non‐hazardous AGOF has not been so,,,,,
