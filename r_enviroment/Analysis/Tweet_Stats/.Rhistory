The p-value of there is a difference between the two age groups

there is likely no difference between the two means.
We are ~92% sure that we can reject the null.
Our confidence interval is (-0.1966269  3.6569075). The
margin of error is +/-1.9267672.
According to our data, there is probably not a relationship
